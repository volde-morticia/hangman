# hangman
Hangman is a guessing game where the player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

This repo consists of my attempt at coding a digital Hangman game with python.

There are 6 lists of words (with more than 20 words each), one of which the player chooses. The code picks a random word from the chosen list, which the player has to guess in 6 tries.

I have used ASCII art and the colorama package to make the game look more fun and lively.
